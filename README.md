Designed with unprecedented speed and reliability, we left behind slow, insecure servers for blazing fast peer-to-peer video and EEG streaming. Using BrainsAtPlayâ€™s API, our platform works with many EEG devices. In addition, powerful image recognition ensures the patient is always within the field of view. Due to not having hardware to work with, we currently only support a synthetic EEG. 

<i> Our application consists of a backend and frontend. For the backend, we created an Express server in Node.js that channels users into Socket.io rooms by a unique ID in their URL. This unique ID, also known as an invite link, allows a patient to join the same room as their doctor, provided the doctor sends the invite link to the patient. Once in the same room, we use WebRTC, Socket.io and Peer.js to coordinate a connection between each caller that continuously sends respectives video streams to each other. For the frontend, we use React for the UI. We use Chart.js to visualize the EEG channels and a simple sine-wave generator for the synthetic EEG. To create the image recognition tracker, we use Tensorflowâ€™s COCO-ssdâ€™s image recognition library.</i>
