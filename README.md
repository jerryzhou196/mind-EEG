Designed with unprecedented speed and reliability, mindEEG leaves behind slow, insecure servers for blazing fast peer-to-peer video and EEG streaming. Using BrainsAtPlayâ€™s API, our platform works with many EEG devices. In addition, powerful image recognition ensures the patient is always within the field of view. 

<i> Our application consists of a backend and frontend. For the backend, I created an Express server in Node.js that channels users into Socket.io rooms by a unique ID in their URL. This unique ID, also known as an invite link, allows a patient to join the same room as their doctor, provided the doctor sends the invite link to the patient. Once in the same room, I use WebRTC, Socket.io and Peer.js to coordinate a connection between each caller that continuously sends respectives video streams to each other. For the frontend, I use React for the UI. I use Chart.js to visualize the EEG channels and a simple sine-wave generator for the synthetic EEG. To create the image recognition tracker, we use Tensorflowâ€™s COCO-ssdâ€™s image recognition library.</i>
